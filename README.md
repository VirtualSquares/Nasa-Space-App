# Nasa-Space-App

In this project, we completed two main steps. First, programming the algorithimic approach. We using the sciPy module to filter out the CSV data provided by NASA, so a lot of the messy noise that would accidentally flag as earthquakes would be removed. We then derived our own method of identifying the location of the earthquake using a combination of means and slopes. Second, we moved on to integrating it onto our website. We worked with the matplotlib libraries and Flask for the backend to succesfully render graphs on the website, and make popup windows. The website itself was coded entirely with html/css.
